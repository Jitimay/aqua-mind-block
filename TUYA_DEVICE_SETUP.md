# Tuya Device Registration

## Step 1: Create Device in Tuya Console

### Go to Tuya IoT Platform
1. Visit https://iot.tuya.com
2. Login with your account
3. Select your project: "AquaMindBlock"

### Create Device Product
1. Go to "Device Development" → "Create Product"
2. Fill in details:
   - **Product Name**: AquaMind Blocks
   - **Category**: Water Management
   - **Communication**: WiFi
   - **Data Protocol**: Custom

### Define Data Points
Add these data points:
```json
{
  "flow": {"type": "Integer", "range": "0-1000"},
  "turbidity": {"type": "Integer", "range": "0-1000"},
  "decision": {"type": "Enum", "range": ["normal","purify","shutdown"]},
  "pump_status": {"type": "Boolean"},
  "valve_status": {"type": "String"}
}
```

## Step 2: Register Your TTGO Device

### Add Device
1. Go to "Device Management" → "Add Device"
2. Select your product
3. Device details:
   - **Device Name**: AquaMind TTGO 001
   - **Device ID**: aquamind_ttgo_001

### Get Device Credentials
After creation, note down:
- **Device ID**: aquamind_ttgo_001
- **Device Secret**: [generated by Tuya]
- **Product Key**: [from your product]

## Step 3: Update Arduino Code
```cpp
// Update in ttgo_real_test.ino
const char* deviceId = "aquamind_ttgo_001";
const char* deviceSecret = "YOUR_DEVICE_SECRET";
const char* productKey = "YOUR_PRODUCT_KEY";
```

## Step 4: Test Connection

### Upload and Monitor
1. Upload updated code to TTGO
2. Open Serial Monitor
3. Look for successful token acquisition
4. Check device appears online in Tuya console

### Verify Data Flow
- Device should appear "Online" in Tuya console
- Real-time data should update every 30 seconds
- Commands sent from console should affect LEDs

## Step 5: Mobile App Integration (Optional)

### Tuya Smart App
1. Download "Tuya Smart" app
2. Login with same account
3. Add device by scanning QR code from console
4. Control and monitor from mobile

## Expected Results
- ✅ Device shows "Online" in Tuya console
- ✅ Real-time sensor data visible
- ✅ AI decisions logged in cloud
- ✅ Commands can be sent to device
- ✅ Mobile app integration working

This gives you **full cloud integration** for the hackathon demo!
